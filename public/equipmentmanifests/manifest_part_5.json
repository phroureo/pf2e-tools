Some tales of the forging report that the sword was Tear of Eventide, a great blade forged out of starlight for the battle between Desna and Aolar. Whether or not that was the case, dwarven curators who examined the shards simply noted that the blade's material was compatible with the cracked gun.

Such gnomes might have difficulties that keep them from exploring or might be preoccupied with other pursuits, but the doll acts as an intermediary, transmitting the benefits of new experiences to its creator via a potent, but passive, psychic link. A bleachguard doll has the alignment and demeanor of its creator, but new experiences can cause the two to diverge. The doll's creator is neither able to control it nor are they constantly aware of its activities.
