The candle can't be snuffed by weather, water, or accident but can be purposefully snuffed through ritual prayer. The candle doesn't release heat and can't be used to start a fire. The candle is never exhausted, regardless of how long it burns.</p>\n<p>The area within the candle's light is a consecrated space. Worshippers of Pharasma within this area gain a +3 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and Perception checks. Undead creatures and worshippers of Urgathoa within this area take a –3 status penalty to those checks.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Soulspark Candle]</p>\n<p>When an undead creature or a haunt comes within the light of a <em>soulspark candle</em>, the candle's flame turns from red to black, makes a loud crackling sound, and releases a flash of bright sparks.

Visible undead can't be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] while limned in these flames. Invisible undead are concealed while limned in these flames, rather than being undetected.

The candle's flame erupts into a mass of fire that burns away undead and haunts. Any undead within the candle's light takes @Damage[20d8[fire]] damage (@Check[fortitude|dc:45|basic|traits:evocation,fire]). Pharasma empowers these flames, allowing them to ignore fire resistance or immunity. Any haunts in the area are instead subject to Pharasma's banishing light. The candle attempts a check to disable each haunt with a +35 modifier. This check applies to any skills applicable to disable the haunt and always has legendary proficiency. Once the candle is Activated in this way, its light immediately goes out, and the candle can't be relit for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> If a <em>soulspark candle</em> is lit by an undead of at least 20th level that worships Urgathoa, the candle burns down as if it were a normal candle over the course of 48 hours. At the end of this time, if the candle is still burning, it burns away completely and is destroyed.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The tip of this <em>+3 major striking greater flaming returning speed longspear</em> is edged with several razor-sharp obsidian blades. The spear has the thrown 30 feet weapon trait, in addition to the normal weapon traits for a longspear.</p>\n<p>While the <em>Spear of the Destroyer's Flame</em> is in your possession, you gain fire resistance 20. When you critically hit a creature with the spear, the creature's blood begins to boil, unleashing blasts of heat from the wound. The creature takes @Damage[2d8[persistent,fire]] damage, in addition to the persistent fire damage from the greater flaming rune; all creatures adjacent to the creature when it takes the persistent fire damage take an equal amount of fire damage. Like the fire damage from the greater flaming rune, this fire damage ignores a creature's fire resistance, though it doesn't ignore fire immunity.</p>\n<p>In addition to its deadliness as a weapon, the <em>Spear of the Destroyer's Flame</em> gives its wielder full control over the Army of Fire, though the orders of the Commander of Flame supersede the orders of anyone wielding the spear, as noted on page 17. While the spear is in your possession, you're aware of the location of the Army of Fire and the army's distance from you. In addition, you can give orders to the Army of Fire, and the army's members will understand and obey you, regardless of what language you speak. If you're within 1 mile of the Army of Fire, the army and its members gain a +10 circumstance bonus to their Speeds. Any members of the Army of Fire within 100 feet of you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Quickened] and can use the additional action to Step, Stride, or Strike. The army remains quickened for 1 minute after moving further than 100 feet from you.</p>\n<p>The Army of Fire has unwavering loyalty to the Commander of Flame, an individual who has completed a special activation that ties their soul to the spear. As long as the Army of Fire can see and hear the Commander of Flame, the army will follow the Commander's orders. The Commander of Flame can sense the presence of the Army of Fire and issue orders, regardless of language, with the same effects as for someone in possession of the spear. The Commander of Flame still needs the spear in hand to muster the Army of Fire, however.</p>\n<p>If the Commander of Flame doesn't hold the <em>Spear of the Destroyer's Flame</em> for 1 week, it returns to Cuetzmonquali's gut, instantly teleporting to the creature's location. If Cuetzmonquali is dead at this time, the spear also resurrects the creature, using the effects of a critical success on a 10th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Resurrect] ritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (envision, Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You attempt to tie your soul to the spear. If the current Commander of Flame still lives, you must attempt either a Will save, Diplomacy check, Intimidation check, or Warfare Lore check. The DC of this check is equal to the current Commander's Will DC, Diplomacy DC, Intimidation DC, or Warfare Lore DC, whichever is highest. On a success, you become the Commander of Flame. On a failure, the current Commander knows your name and appearance and is aware of your exact location for 24 hours. Activate 1 hour (envision, Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per week</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You use the spear's power to muster the Army of Fire. You can choose to either call the Army of Fire to your location or move yourself to the army's location. When calling the army, you select an area you can see within 500 feet. The army is instantly teleported to the location you select, spreading out as necessary to arrive safely. When moving yourself, you instantly teleport yourself to a location within 500 feet of the army. The army is composed of souls given form as burning humanoids, elementals, spirits, and undead.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> If the entire Army of Fire is destroyed and the Commander of Flame is slain with the <em>Spear of the Destroyer's Flame</em>, the spear shatters into a massive explosion of flame, dealing @Damage[20d10[fire]] damage in a @Template[burst|distance:30] (@Check[reflex|dc:43|basic|name:Spear of the Destroyer's Flame Destruction|traits:evocation,magical,fire] save). In addition, the Commander's soul burns away to nothing, destroying the Commander forever and releasing the bound souls of the Army of Fire to the River of Souls.</p>",
