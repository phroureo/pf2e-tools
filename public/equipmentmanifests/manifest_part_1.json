    "description": "<p>This immaculate golden set of merchant's scales is considered a divine instrument among Abadar's most faithful. Unlike most scales, this one has only a single dish for placing small objects, and calculates value rather than weight. On the other side of the fulcrum, a steel arrow indicator points to various numbers engraved on the side of the scale.</p>\n<p>By placing an object of light Bulk onto the dish, you can determine its value in gold pieces in the market in which the scale was made (most of these scales are made in Katapesh or Absalom), based on its material composition and artisanship.</p>\n<p>For example, after placing a gemstone on the dish, the scale will indicate the fairest (average, in most cases) price you can expect to fetch in the market to which the scale is calibrated, but the scale wouldn't detect the gemstone's historical significance or any magical properties. <em>Abadar's flawless scale</em> can be calibrated to a different market by performing a 1-hour ritual in the proximity of that market.</p>",

The gem he chose was amber—to show his clan that a union between stone and leaf was possible. His family remained hesitant, despite the unmistakable love that the men shared. The tales then say that it was Folgrit who grew impatient and transformed the stones as a sign of her approval.</p>\n<p>Since then, more sets of these have been created, but doing so is an unsure process. Some of the stones are seemingly given their magical abilities at random, which most attribute as further blessings from Folgrit. Each set of affinity stones typically comes as a pair of gems set into worn items such as hilts, necklaces, or rings, though some sets of affinity stones feature additional gems. The full set of stones must be invested together across multiple creatures, or else their magic fails to function. To invest these items, one person must be a dwarf and everyone must perform a one-hour ceremony that includes divulging their innermost feelings. Their love need not be romantic, but it must be genuine and deep. If they pass this test, they receive the following benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are always aware of each other and permanently gain the effects of the Status spell.</li>\n<li>Non-dwarves gain the benefits of a 1st- or 5th-level ancestry feat with the dwarf trait, and dwarves gain the benefits one 1st- or 5th-level ancestry feat with a trait corresponding to the ancestry of another person with which the affinity stones are invested. For example, if you share investment in the stones with a halfling, you can take halfling ancestry feats. You can't use these feats to meet prerequisites, but the benefits of the feats otherwise function as if you had taken the feat.</li>\n<li>You gradually take on some of the physical characteristics of your counterparts.

However, at first it was completely incapable of expressing itself. This led a seething frustration to grow within the weapon, as it yearned desperately to respond to the same love and affection that created it. Through decades of effort, it gained the ability to communicate empathically, then telepathically. Now, the weapon is capable of exerting its influence over other inanimate objects. Despite the weapon's progress, years of feeling helpless have given the <em>animate dreamer</em> a singular goal: to obtain and occupy a body of its own.</p>\n<p>An <em>animate dreamer</em> is cunning, intelligent, and patient.

Therefore, an <em>animate dreamer</em> is just as happy in a living body stolen from an innocent as it would be in an artificially constructed body, or even an undead corpse.

    "description": "<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The aquarium lamp is a combination light source and exotic animal aquarium, intended to provide rich nobles amusement and illumination. It takes the shape of a glass cube 50 feet wide and seven feet high filled with sea water, flanked by two much smaller water tanks. A sparse brass frame around the device keeps the tanks themselves from touching the ground and serves as a mounting point for a pair of electrical coils on the top, which are enclosed within separate glass tubes. Six electric eels swim within the central tank, while a number of animals belonging to species considered to be the eels' natural prey swim in the smaller feeding tanks. With the simple pull of a lever attached to either smaller tank, one of the prey animals is released into the eel tank. Within seconds, the eels converge on the hapless animal, using their electrical charges to stun their victims. When this happens, the salty seawater conducts the electrical energy into transfer coils hidden within the brass frame, which send the energy to the top-mounted electrical coils. The end result produces enough light to fully illuminate a room as though it were midday.</p>\n<p>This device is an expression of a recent trend among certain Avistani nobles to blend form and function in their manors' interior decorations. In such circles, ostentatious decorations that serve no functional purpose are derided as \"tacky\" and \"unrefined.\" If a noble in such company wishes not to be ridiculed, they must be sure that each decoration adds something to the room beyond the aesthetic. The aquarium lamp is the latest tool in this social arms race, and it's already proven popular with its target market.</p>\n<p>When active, the aquarium lamp produces bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet). Each activation provides enough energy for 10 minutes of use, and the two feeding tanks combined carry enough prey animals for 50 activations before needing to be refilled, though electric eels usually need feeding only once per day, and won't go after the prey if they're all full. While electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years if kept well-fed.</p>",

However, she still harbored in her heart a fierce pride in what dwarves had accomplished. She had long fought against the cult of Droskar, seeing it as emblematic of all the worst parts of dwarven culture.</p>\n<p>By the time she infiltrated Droskar's Crucible in 4065 AR, the cult was already in decline. She knew portions of Droskar's Crucible were built by the worshippers of Torag who preceded the cult and that something of great power had been locked away in the Lower Vault, but not what that object was. If she could gain control over the cult, she could simultaneously use them to open the Lower Vault and convince them to set aside their worship of Droskar-if not for her own patron, Cayden Cailean, then any other faith with a more positive leaning.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, her attempt to seize control of the cult using their own traditions against them backfired when she succumbed to the Soul Smith. Unlike the others who were slain by the Soul Smith, Azarim's soul managed to somewhat escape being bound into the Soul Smith's soul chain by instead seeking shelter in her own magic rapier. Frustrated at the fact her soul slipped away but ignorant of where that soul fled to, the Soul Smith returned to his tasks and soon forgot about Azarim-she was, to the undead dwarf, just another in a long line of failures.</p>\n<p>Today, <em>Azarim</em> is an intelligent <em>+1 striking Shifting rapier</em>. The rapier has been waiting patiently for centuries for a new, like-minded ally to take her up in arms against her foes.</p>\n<p>While she prefers to exist in the form of a rapier, she can use one of her actions to activate her shifting rune to take the shape of another weapon as needed.</p>\n<p>While <em>Azarim</em> prefers to be wielded by chaotic good characters, particularly those who worship Cayden Cailean, she's open-minded and eager to work with any wielder who seeks to oppose corrupting or toxic traditions in society, particularly those who work against the influence of the cult of Droskar. To wielders she doesn't approve of, she works to convince them to either change their ways or to hand her over to someone who she can work with, resorting to her ability to induce weakness in her carrier as needed when simply having them discard her is the only option left.</p>\n<p><em>Azarim</em> deals an additional 1d6 spirit damage to worshippers of Droskar, to creatures allied with Droskar's faith, and to those who are under the influence of Droskar's faith-which includes the Kobold King Merlokrep for as long as he continues to wear his crown as well as most of the intelligent inhabitants of the deeper levels of Droskar's Crucible.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span></p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature picks up <em>Azarim</em> or begins its turn carrying <em>Azarim</em></p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The creature who carries <em>Azarim</em> becomes Enfeebled{Enfeebled 2}.

These weapons can be either melee weapons or ranged weapons.

Such gnomes might have difficulties that keep them from exploring or might be preoccupied with other pursuits, but the doll acts as an intermediary, transmitting the benefits of new experiences to its creator via a potent, but passive, psychic link. A bleachguard doll has the alignment and demeanor of its creator, but new experiences can cause the two to diverge. The doll's creator is neither able to control it nor are they constantly aware of its activities. If the original creator perishes, the doll sometimes becomes inert (essentially dying as well), sometimes remains an intelligent item, and sometimes becomes a normal soulbound doll, diminished in power but with some of the item's capabilities.</p>\n<p>Once per day, the doll sends its creator a dream of the day's events. Each bleachguard doll can cast the cantrips light (3rd level), prestidigitation, and one other 3rd-rank cantrip, along with one spell (at 3rd level) that can be cast once per day.

    "description": "<p>This strong, rich red-brown home brew has no listed ingredients, but smells of earth and is both smoky and surprisingly bitter. Although Skogg Bloodhammer insists that the drink doesn't exist, it's somewhat of an open secret among his close friends. He prefers to share this drink at backroom gatherings with these trusted friends, and usually broaches the idea of sharing with a full mug and a question: \"You ever thought about being a frog?\"</p>\n<p>After drinking the brew, you transform into an animal, gaining the effects of Animal Form except you can't Dismiss the effect, and you transform into a random animal battle form. To determine the battle form, roll [[/r 1d10 #Animal Form]] (1 = ape, 2 = bear, 3 = bull, 4 = canine, 5 = cat, 6 = deer, 7 = frog, 8 = shark, 9 = snake, 10 = reroll). Your appearance while in the battle form resembles that of animals within Emperor's Peak or from the surrounding Five Kings Mountains, such as the Five Kings dart snake or the Coldforge singing frog. More unusual battle forms like apes and sharks instead resemble a typical member of that species.</p>",

Once activated, the mask sharpens odors, giving you imprecise scent with a 60 foot range. You can't wear other masks while you're wearing a bloodhound mask.</p>\n<p>When you use Survival to Track a creature by its scent, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level even if you're untrained, and the mask grants you a +3 item bonus to your Survival check. The GM sets the Survival DC based on the area's ability to hold scent rather than on visual clues, as normal for using scent.</p>\n<p></p>",
