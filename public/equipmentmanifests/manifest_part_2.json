However, at first it was completely incapable of expressing itself. This led a seething frustration to grow within the weapon, as it yearned desperately to respond to the same love and affection that created it. Through decades of effort, it gained the ability to communicate empathically, then telepathically. Now, the weapon is capable of exerting its influence over other inanimate objects. Despite the weapon's progress, years of feeling helpless have given the <em>animate dreamer</em> a singular goal: to obtain and occupy a body of its own.</p>\n<p>An <em>animate dreamer</em> is cunning, intelligent, and patient.

An <em>animate dreamer</em> desires a permanent body but isn't picky about the body's form or the methods it has to use in order to gain it. Therefore, an <em>animate dreamer</em> is just as happy in a living body stolen from an innocent as it would be in an artificially constructed body, or even an undead corpse.

    "description": "<p>This 75-foot length of silk rope is lightweight and appears to be inlaid with golden threads.

The rope splits itself into the requested piece, leaving the remaining length intact. If the rope isn't long enough to provide the requested amount, the activation fails.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The rope is split into two or more pieces</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The rope attempts to reassemble itself. All pieces of the rope within 500 feet slither back toward you, moving 50 feet per round, over the span of 1 minute. Obstacles and other creatures can prevent a piece of rope from reaching you. Once all pieces reach you or the minute has passed, the pieces rejoin, becoming a single rope. The length of this reformed rope is equal to the total length of all the pieces together; if a piece is missing, the rope is now shorter than its original 50-foot length. Any pieces that didn't rejoin with the rest of the rope remain where they are after the minute passes.</p>",
