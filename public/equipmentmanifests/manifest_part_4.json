The first, a delicate brush and a jar of extremely fine dust, is used to reveal fingerprints left behind by most humanoid creatures. The dust sticks to the natural oils left behind on smooth surfaces. When you use the kit to determine whether or not creatures left behind a fingerprint at a crime scene, the GM rolls a secret Thievery check against the Thievery DC of every creature capable of leaving prints that has interacted with the scene. On a success, you locate a clear print from that creature and carefully transfer it to a special sheet of sticky paper. (Note that fingerprints can last for days, and prints collected in this manner often include those of victims, witnesses, and unrelated passersby.) At the GM's discretion, the print-leaving creature might get a bonus to its Thievery DC for taking special precautions. In other cases, finding a print might be impossible (such as if the creature was wearing gloves or if the location has been significantly compromised).</p>\n<p>The second part of the kit is a small sheaf of paper and a pad soaked in ink. By forcing a humanoid creature with fingerprints to roll a finger across the pad and then press it to the paper, you can obtain an image of the unique whorls in that creature's fingerprints. These can then be compared to any prints found at a crime scene. Successfully determining whether or not two prints match requires a DC 15 perception check-the GM should roll this check secretly as well, since a failed check may result in false information.</p>",

You can use this ability to bring back to life a creature that requires a Wish ritual or divine intervention to raise from the dead, as long as you choose no other creatures within 60 feet to recover. Once you use this activation, you are turned into a perfect statue made from stone or metal that depicts you in a glorious pose honoring your sacrifice, and you can never be restored. The <em>Forgefather's seal</em> remains on this statue and can be transferred to another suit of armor or a runestone as normal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Using the <em>Forgefather's seal</em> ability to bring the dead back to life on an evil demigod causes it to shatter in a violent explosion that destroys the seal and the statue made as part of the sacrifice, erasing all knowledge of the user from existence.

A hand cannon can be used to fire almost anything that can be packed into its barrel. The wielder of a hand cannon can change the damage type granted by its modular trait as part of the same Interact action used to reload.</p>",
