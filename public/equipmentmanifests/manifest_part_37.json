Whenever you invest the same <em>silvanshee collar</em>, the silvanshee who appears is the same one you named and chose the first time. If you already have a pet, familiar, or other companion that uses the Pet feat, that pet can change its shape as an action to appear as a silvanshee agathion at will (while perhaps retaining some of your pet's cosmetic traits at your option), but this doesn't otherwise alter your existing pet's statistics.</p>\n<p>As long as you wear the <em>silvanshee collar</em>, you gain a +3 item bonus to Performance checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to Gather Information. When you invest it, you either increase your Charisma modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.
