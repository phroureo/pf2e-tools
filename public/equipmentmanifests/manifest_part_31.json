Upon drinking the potion, your appearance changes, taking on different sex characteristics in line with another gender expression. You have little control over the details of the change, but it lines up with your deepest heartfelt ideal. More importantly, unlike the <em>serum of sex shift</em>, a potion of passing fancy doesn't impart the \"family resemblance\" effect; thus, a drinker too shy or afraid of being recognized to publicly express another gender as themself can experience the change more anonymously.</p>\n<p>A <em>potion of passing fancy's</em> effects last for 1 hour before slowly fading over 10 minutes; drinking another before the effect fully ends resets its duration and undoes any fading.

    "description": "<p>Created by the Kellid goddess Sister Cinder to lead her believers out of the Age of Darkness, this hand-held lamp is constructed from animal bone, hide, and sinew, and it contains an eternal flame that requires neither fuel nor oxygen to burn. The lamp's flame can be covered or hidden, but it can't be smothered or quenched. While uncovered, the <em>Primordial Flame</em> sheds bright light in a 100-foot radius (and dim light for the next 100 feet). If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, the <em>Primordial Flame</em> attempts to counteract the darkness with a counteract rank of 10 and a counteract modifier of [[/r 1d20+35 #Counteract]]{+35}.</p>\n<p>The presence of the <em>Primordial Flame</em> alters the surrounding environment, changing weather patterns, temperature, climate, and even seasons. Within a 10-mile radius of the <em>Primordial Flame</em>, the temperature remains 70Â° F (21Â° C) during the day and 60Â° F (16Â° C) at night. The weather is calm and free from extreme weather conditions (such as blizzards, hail, thunderstorms, and tornadoes), and the sky remains clear. Plants in the area flourish as if they were receiving optimal sunlight, water, and nutrients for their species, despite the lack of precipitation. If the <em>Primordial Flame</em> remains in the same region for an extended time, the area of this effect increases (typically by 1 mile each year, though terrain and other factors might alter this limit). During the time Venexus carried the <em>Primordial Flame</em>, its environmental reach expanded to cover the entirety of Lost Mammoth Valley.</p>\n<p><strong>Cursed</strong> The <em>Primordial Flame</em> was cursed by Syarstik Painted-Tiger, the guardian spirit of Red Cat Cave. As long as it remains cursed, a creature that holds the <em>Primordial Flame</em> can't willingly give up possession. A creature that has held the <em>Primordial Flame</em> and no longer has it in their possession is wracked with mental anguish, becoming Clumsy{Clumsy 4}, Enfeebled{Enfeebled 4}, Stupefied{Stupefied 4}, and Fatigued; these conditions can't be reduced or removed until the creature regains possession of the <em>Primordial Flame</em> or the curse is removed.

Using the press, a worker can produce up to 3,600 identical pages per day. In order to use the printing press, you must first set the type for the page you want to print. Time required to set type varies depending on the number of characters used; from 1 hour for small pages with brief text, to 8 hours for a full-sized normal page of text, though extreme examples may be outside this range. When you prepare a page for printing, you can include engraved images in addition to text. No magical properties of text are transferred in the printing process, so it cannot be used to mass-produce magical scrolls, Rune Trap, or similar spells or magic items.</p>",
