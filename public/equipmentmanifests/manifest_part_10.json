The colors shift abruptly and unpredictably within and the opening of the bottle is sealed tighter than any other potion or alchemical item, emphasizing its dangers. On a successful Strike, the creature takes @Damage[1[force]] damage. Then, roll on the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.rollable-tables.RollTable.Wellspring Surges] table. The result affects all creatures within the emanation indiscriminately. For the purpose of determining the effects of the surge, use a spell rank of 4 and a DC of 23. The person Striking with this vial is considered to be the caster for the purposes of determining effects on the Mana Surge table. The emanation is centered on the target's space, and both the caster and the target of the wellspring surge are the target of the condensed mana. On a failed Strike, the surge only has an effect if it would normally affect an area; if you roll an effect that depends on a caster or a target, nothing happens. If the effect normally doesn't have a DC, creatures affected by the surge or within the surge's area must attempt a @Check[reflex|dc:23] save instead. On a critical failure on any saving throw against condensed mana, the creature is Stunned by the wild energies of the surge. Sometimes a wellspring surge's effects make it difficult to determine exactly who is affected. The GM makes the determination, basing it on creatures directly affected; for example, while many creatures can hear the music from the surge \"strike up the band,\" only the creature emanating the music is directly affected by it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You must be in or adjacent to an area of Mana Wastes miasma.</p>",

Traditionally, all participants in a complex discussion start their conversation with a tea ceremony involving covenant tea, with each member of the group enjoying the covenant of the shared beverage. Some have been known to use trickery and sleight of hand to ensure only those whose goals align with the tea preparer are served covenant tea, while others in the group are served non-magical (but still delicious) green tea, thus subtly tipping the balance in discussion toward those the tea server favors. This practice has resulted in some regions referring to covenant tea as \"trickery tea.\" Regardless of what you prefer to call the tea, when you drink it, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks and to your Perception DC for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tea Ceremony</strong> The duration increases to 1 hour.</p>",

You create a magical doorway within the surface that a creature can move through, as if the door had always been there. The doorway can penetrate up to 10 feet of material; particularly thick material, such as heavy stone walls, can cause this effect to fail, expending its use for the day. You can use an Interact action on the door to remove it from the surface and return it to its previous shape.</p>",
