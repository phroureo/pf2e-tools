Eventually, the essence of their earnest and adventurous spirit has so thoroughly inundated the item it gains a matching spirit and will of its own. Such armbands view themselves as a tough, but fair, trainer for whomever inherits them next, inspiring you to new heights of athleticism. They also spoil for contests, telepathically calling out competitors on your behalf; typically the armbands won't challenge a foe you're unprepared to face, but particularly eager wrestler's armbands might have an unfortunate habit of overestimating your abilities and pushing you into a conflict that's beyond your proven capacity. These armbands have the following activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> command</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You succeed or critically succeed at an Athletics check</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The armbands taunt a creature you're competing with, boasting of your prowess and attempting an Intimidation check to Demoralize that creature.</p>",
