The raw materials of a <em>necrobinding serum</em> are composed of a slurry made from the creator's own flesh and blood mixed with pulped fungal toxins. The exact ingredients vary, but the act of brewing a necrobinding serum is typically viewed with distaste at best and, in many societies, is regarded as an evil act. While <em>necrobinding serum</em> isn't a poison, its method of delivery is identical to that of an injury poison-it's applied to a weapon that's then used to Strike an undead target (living creatures suffer no additional effect from exposure to a dose of <em>necrobinding serum</em>).

When placed on a flat surface, a creature within reach can Interact to flip the lever, turning the machine on.

A front-mounted metal grate prevents anyone from coming into accidental contact with the spinning blades without impeding airflow.</p>\n<p>The nightbreeze machine was recently commissioned by Malduoni, Keeper of the First Law, leader of the nation of Rahadoum.

    "description": "<p>An <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> is a potent artifact rumored to have been created by one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a way to reward those who work as their agents on the Material Plane. More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre-Earthfall death cult that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen.</p>\n<p>An <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills you with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes 4d6 bleed damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can be removed only by ripping it free (causing the same amount of persistent bleed damage as the initial plucking). When you place the oculus in your empty eye socket, you immediately heal all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus grants you constant Darkvision. It can also be activated to perform a number of other magical effects, as detailed below, but if you aren't evil, each time you activate an <em>oculus of Abaddon</em>, you must succeed at a @Check[will|dc:36] save or become affected by a subconscious suggestion (heightened to 8th level) to perform an evil act the next time an opportunity to do so arises, as determined by the GM.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (envision)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> three times per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain the effects of Scrying, heightened to 7th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> Cast a Spell</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per week</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You use the <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> to cast a Binding Circle ritual, heightened to 7th level.

If you already know the planar binding ritual, you gain a +3 item bonus on the primary check when casting planar binding.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> envision;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirement</strong> you have a familiar or animal companion</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You can see and hear through your familiar or animal companion's eyes and ears, provided you are on the same plane.

This functions as Suggestion, but with a range of 1 mile. All creatures within this area are affected, with the same suggestion implanted in their minds. Creatures hear the telepathic suggestion in their native language, and creatures that are 7th level or higher can attempt a DC 36 will save to resist the effect. This power was used by Vordakai to cause the vanishing of Varnhold, suggesting to its inhabitants to leave their homes and travel south to his tomb. If this effect is counteracted or removed on one victim, it ends for all victims.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> A foul and hideous object, an <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> is fortunately relatively easy to destroy, as far as artifacts go. It has Hardness 25 and 100 Hit Points, but repairs damage to itself swiftly, regaining 10 Hit Points per round. It has weakness 10 to bludgeoning damage and weakness 30 to holy.</p>",
