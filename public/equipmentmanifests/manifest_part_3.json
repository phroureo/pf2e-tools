If the wearer begins to succumb, the <em>corruption cassock</em> gradually reverts to its true appearance, replacing its false iconography as its wearer converts.</p>\n<p>A <em>corruption cassock</em> functions as a <em>cassock of devotion</em> for any wearer it chooses. Once you invest the cassock, it fuses to you.

It does neither. The GM secretly adjusts your checks with those skills, causing you to fail at religious tasks more often. If you have multiple equal or lower item bonuses to the affected skills, the cassock takes precedence, negating those bonuses. If you convert to following the cassock's true evil deity, however, these bonuses function normally for you.</p>\n<p>If you attempt to Cast a Spell with an alignment trait that doesn't match the cassock's, it can force you to attempt a @Check[will|dc:28] save.

Yet Gristogar wasn't equal to his own ambitions, and before he could complete the Crown of Toil, his cult died out and he ended his own life. For centuries, the incomplete crown lay dormant, but over that time, fragments of Gristogar's soul infused it-not enough to transform it into a truly intelligent item, but enough to give it a rudimentary need and desire to be completed.</p>\n<p>When the Kobold King Merlokrep discovered the discarded crown and placed it upon his head, the crown at last had agency- if not in a hale and hearty dwarf, at least in the frame of a powerful and ambitious kobold. Just as the crown began influencing Merlokrep, so too did the Kobold King's personality influence the crown. Today, the device is known as the <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>, and while it still urges the one who wears it to build a kingdom of endlessly toiling workers, it no longer does so in honor of Droskar. Instead, it seeks the rise of a brutal kobold kingdom.</p>\n<p>The crown appears as a golden band surrounded by iron spikes that glisten with fresh blood-the addition of a kobold skull to the top is largely decorative, but one the crown has grown to \"enjoy.\" Even in its incomplete state, a few rituals away from its true potential, the Crown of the Kobold King is a potent item.

While this is normally a disadvantage, if you have light blindness, you aren't Dazzled in bright light as long as you continue wearing the day goggles, since to your eyes, there is only dim light. You can wear the goggles around your neck or on your forehead, granting no benefits, but allowing you to move them over your eyes with a single Interact action, without having to withdraw them first.</p>",

The dragon holds a scroll in its two front claws that bears the inscription \"So that the memory of war may be truthfully recalled.\"</p>\n<p>A creature who activates the drum is bound to join its army after death. Once their spirit has fought in a hundred and one battles, they are freed to face whatever fate their soul has earned. However, until this duty is discharged, the dead creature cannot be resurrected, nor can their soul be captured by any other means.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Summon Dragon-Lotus Army</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> (concentrate, incarnate, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once every 20 years</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Spend a Mythic Point; beating the drum summons a spectral army to an area you designate within 500 feet. The army takes its Arrive action when you finish playing. At the end of your next turn, the army Strides up to 60 feet and then takes its Depart action. The Dragon-Lotus Army follows your orders and attempts to not harm you and your allies when possible. The spectral force isn't fully a creature. It can't take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes, spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as Dispel Magic). The army is Gargantuan, but it doesn't block movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Arrive</strong> (emotion, fear, mental, sonic) <em>The Sound of Thunder</em> The beating of the drum amplifies to become like the stomping of hundreds of booted feet. The Dragon- Lotus Army appears in perfect formation and gives a brief, staccato battle cry. All enemies in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] around the army take @Damage[16d10[sonic]|options:area-damage] damage (DC 48 fortitude save); each creature who fails its save is also Frightened{Frightened 3} (Frightened{Frightened 4} on a critical failure).</p>\n<p><strong>Depart</strong> <em>Devastating Charge</em> The army readies their motley collection of weapons and Strides forward up to 100 feet in a straight line. Each creature it moves through takes 20d8 @Damage[20d8[bludgeoning]|options:area-damage]{bludgeoning}, @Damage[20d8[piercing]|options:area-damage]{piercing}, or @Damage[20d8[slashing]|options:area-damage]{slashing} damage (whichever would be most harmful at the GM's discretion) with a DC 48 reflex save. A creature who critically fails its save is also knocked Prone.</p><hr /><p><strong>Destruction</strong> If the <em>Dragon-Lotus Drum</em> is captured by an enemy of Hwanggot (such as a warring rival nation) and then played continually for 1 week while singing anthems that disparage Hwanggot and its leaders, the drum falls to pieces and the souls bound to it are obliterated.</p>",

After Ancil's death, the weapon was passed down, per his own decree, not to his heirs but to the greatest defender of Alkenstar, as determined by the weapon's previous owner.

Inside, scrawled across its parchment pages in a delicate, spidery script, is a lengthy list of names that always appears in a reader's native alphabet.

    "description": "<p>This enormous, multifaceted prism normally rests on a pedestal, eerily refracting many-colored lights even when no light source is present. In reality, the prism refracts the four magical essences into the visible spectrum. A creature adjacent to the prism can adjust its facets with an Interact action to change between two polarities. Two essences flow from two input streams into the prism, where the prism combines them into a single output stream; alternatively, a single essence flows from one input stream into the prism and is split into two output streams. A creature that enters and stays within an input essence stream for 1 minute is slowly encased in solid magic, at which point it is paralyzed until anyone reverses the prism's flow or finishes activating the prism. A creature stepping into an output essence stream is gently pushed back and out of the stream.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You alter and rearrange the facets of the essence prism, adjusting the essences to select for a single quality, which might be associated with mental essence, like a personality trait; material essence, like a physical quality; vital essence, like a belief or instinct; or spiritual essence, like an alignment component such as good or lawful. You must succeed at a secret DC 30 skill check with a skill associated with a magical tradition that uses the essence you chose (for instance, Arcana or Occultism for mental essence, as arcane and occult magic both use mental essence). On a failure, you accidentally set the prism for some other quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The prism has only one input stream, and a creature is encased in magic in the input stream</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Over the course of the next hour, the creature in the input stream has its essences refracted through the prism, creating two cocoons of magic in the output streams that each contain a new creature. At the end of the process, the original creature is gone, and the two new creatures break free of their cocoons. Each creature is part of the original, separated from the rest based on the last quality set by the prism's first activation. For instance, if you set the prism to \"good\", one creature would have all the original creature's good aspects and the other would be the original creature's evil side. Unless you selected a physical quality, both new creatures look just like the original. The new creatures are usually 2 levels lower than the original, but if the original creature was strongly biased with respect to the quality you chose (for instance, if splitting out the good and evil side of a redeemer), the stronger creature is 1 level lower and the weaker creature is 3 or more levels lower. If calibrated correctly, this activation can also reverse the effect of the third activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The prism has two input streams, and a creature is encased in magic in each of the input streams</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Over the course of the next hour, the essences of both creatures in the input streams are refracted through the prism, creating a cocoon of magic in the output stream that contains a new creature. At the end of the process, the original creatures are gone, and the new creature breaks free of its cocoon. The new creature is an amalgam of the originals, with a new personality blended from both, and is usually 1 or 2 levels higher than the higher level of the original creatures unless the lower-level creature was much weaker. This activation also reverses the effect of the second activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Forcing the <em>essence prism</em> to combine two incompatible demigods destroys the prism, though it might also result in a new divinity.</p>",
