    "description": "<p>This string of beads appears to be a hemp string with lustrous red beads of various sizes hanging from it. When activated, it briefly appears in its true form: a golden chain with golden spheres attached by fine threads.</p>\n<p>This necklace has one @Damage[18d6[fire]|options:area-damage] damage, three @Damage[16d6[fire]|options:area-damage] damage and five @Damage[14d6[fire]|options:area-damage] damage beads with a DC 39 reflex save. When all the beads are gone, the necklace becomes a non-magical hemp string.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">A</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You detach a sphere from the necklace, causing it to glow with orange light. After you activate a sphere, if you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact action with the ranged trait), it detonates as a Fireball where it lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireball anywhere within 70 feet, though at the GM's discretion you might need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. If no one hurls the sphere by the start of your next turn, it turns into a non-magical red bead.</p>",

No matter how many knives you pull from the necklace, you never seem to deplete them. Wooden daggers from the necklace are as effective as ordinary steel daggers and can be useful to stake vampires.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This beautiful necklace appears to be a magical item such as a necklace of fireballs or a pendant of the occult. When invested, it magically locks in place, suspiciously tightly, and fuses to you. When you enter a situation of extreme stress (as determined by the GM), the necklace tightens around your neck, suffocating you and dealing @Damage[30[bludgeoning]] damage to you at the end of each of your turns. Once per round, you can spend a single action to attempt a @Check[athletics|dc:34] check or @Check[fortitude|dc:34] save; success means you don't take the damage on your current turn, but you continue suffocating. The necklace loosens after you've been dead for a month.</p>",
