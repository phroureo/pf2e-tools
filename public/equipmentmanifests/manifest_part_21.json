You and those you consider to be allies must succeed at a @Check[will|dc:16] save or you perceive the illusion as you intended it, though others won't.

The tube's twin prongs are placed into the user's nostrils, after which the user squeezes the rubber ball to activate the device, forcing the vapor into the user's body through their nose.

Nobody remembers who first invented the <em>holy steam ball</em>; they're likely lost to history because most initially thought it was a scam. After receiving endorsement from the Mendevian Crusade, a team of alchemists and inventors were able to determine the vapor's exact composition and mass produce them.
