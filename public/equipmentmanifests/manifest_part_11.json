    "description": "<p>Originally, this magical crown was to be known as the Crown of Toil-a magic item crafted by the dwarven priest named Gristogar. He intended for the crown to bolster his ability to rule and herald in a new era of a dwarven kingdom that followed the teachings of Droskar. Yet Gristogar wasn't equal to his own ambitions, and before he could complete the Crown of Toil, his cult died out and he ended his own life. For centuries, the incomplete crown lay dormant, but over that time, fragments of Gristogar's soul infused it-not enough to transform it into a truly intelligent item, but enough to give it a rudimentary need and desire to be completed.</p>\n<p>When the Kobold King Merlokrep discovered the discarded crown and placed it upon his head, the crown at last had agency- if not in a hale and hearty dwarf, at least in the frame of a powerful and ambitious kobold. Just as the crown began influencing Merlokrep, so too did the Kobold King's personality influence the crown. Today, the device is known as the <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>, and while it still urges the one who wears it to build a kingdom of endlessly toiling workers, it no longer does so in honor of Droskar. Instead, it seeks the rise of a brutal kobold kingdom.</p>\n<p>The crown appears as a golden band surrounded by iron spikes that glisten with fresh blood-the addition of a kobold skull to the top is largely decorative, but one the crown has grown to \"enjoy.\" Even in its incomplete state, a few rituals away from its true potential, the Crown of the Kobold King is a potent item.

Originally called the Zibikian staff in honor of its creator, the green man Zibik, with whom Ghorus communed before magically receiving this staff. Ghorus spent years using samples of the staff's spores to invent weapons for his war against Taldor.</p>\n<p>When you invest this staff, a thin layer of fungi grows on your hands, remaining until your next daily preparations. If an enemy takes damage from any of the spells you cast by the <em>Cythbikian staff</em>, this fungus spreads up your arms, and you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double that spell's level. These temporary Hit Points last 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Rule by Roots</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> (fungus, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per week</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You plunge the <em>Cythbikian staff</em> into the earth, causing a vast fungal network to spread out from the staff, coating the ground, plants, structures, and all creatures in a @Template[emanation|distance:100] (@Check[reflex|dc:34] avoids) until the staff is removed or 24 hours have passed. Non-magical plants in the area die. A creature covered by these fungal growths is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Grabbed] and controlled, physically, by the fungus, as it moves them around like a living puppet. At the beginning of a grabbed creature's turn, they can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Escape] (DC 34). On a failure, the fungus forces them to spend all of their remaining actions moving toward and attacking the nearest creature in the area using melee Strikes with any weapon at their disposal. The fungal growths pay no mind to how the bodies under their control operate, and grabbed creatures are twisted, bent, and contorted in ways that harm their body. Each round, at the end of a grabbed creature's turn, they take @Damage[8d6[bludgeoning]] damage from this painful manipulation (@Check[fortitude|dc:34|basic] save). A creature that successfully Escapes or is physically removed from the area is no longer grabbed or controlled. When the <em>Cythbikian staff</em> is removed from the ground, or after 24 hours have passed, the mold dies and this effect ends.
